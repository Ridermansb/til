	- Use [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) to generate git commit with emojis
	  Usage `gitmoji -c`
- [[next.js]]
	- Pre-configured routes
	- SSR
	- use `npx create-next-app my-app` to create new Next.js project

		- new way to handle routes is putting inside `app` folder
		- folder inside `app` that is between `[` and `]` are dynamic slugs
		- folder inside `app` that is between `(` and `)` are ignored by router system
		- be carefull with special file names `page`, `layout`, `loading`, `error`, `head` and `template`
		- Vercel is responsable for next.js
		- Try use Turbopack for build system (add `--turbo` in the `next dev` script to use it)
		- `getServerSideProps` was replaced by `export` with const props
		- `fetch(<url>, { next: { revalidate: 10 } })` is telling next to generate the page again after 10s (ISR)
		- To static generation use export `generateStaticParams` function
		- Export `loading.tsx` component that handle loading state and same for `error`
		- `'use client'` tell next.js to render this only in the browser
		- use `useRouter()` hook to get router functions like `router.refresh()` to refresh the page

		- Intercept router
			- Allow intercept navigation between pages
			- Create folder inside the route that you wants to intercept with name `(..)`, that means one level  up following by the route that we want \, eg: `(..)about`. Then create file `page.tsx` with the new page

		- `'use server'` tell next.js to render this only in the server
		- use `revalidatePath(<path>)` to refresh the path after make some changes on API
		- Inside the route / folder you can create `actions.ts` file with `use server` to handle API Calls and in your component use `yourFunctoin.bind(null, <params>)` or you can use `useFormState` hook
		- Try use `actions.ts` and `form.tsx` files to handle forms and actions

		- `"use client"`means that the component will be hydrated on client
		- on next configuration you can specify (tag) some fetch api and then use `revalidateTags` to update tags
	- {{video https://youtu.be/5QP0mvrJkiY?si=97Tjf1XHYydqVNk8}}
		- If you want's to keep as server component use `import 'server-only'`  to ensure that if you import into client component you will get error (BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS)
		- Don't use `use server` in components because by default all react component are server component. by doing this you are basically creating route like `GET` method
		- Use `dynamic(() => <MyComponent />, { ssr: false })` to dynamic import component when is needed and not in SSR
		- Use `supressHydrationWarning` to ignore hydration errors (make sure you know what you are doing)
		- It's ok to fetch multiples times in diferents components since next.js cache the fetch for you
		- For ORMs you can use `import { cache } from 'react` to cache the results or you can use `next/cache`
		- Tipically use `"use serve"` on actions
		- Use `revalidatePath(<path to your route>)`after doing some actions (like POST, DELETE or PUT) to update your UI. Do this in your action just after
		- server actions can be used in client components
		- use `import { redirect } from 'next/navigation' to redirect to another path
		- `"use server"` not guarantee that this action will run only on server.. this is actually exposing the endpoint to the world. TO make sure that the action runs only on the server, use `import 'server-only' utility
		- `params` and `searchParams` are variables available in page component
		- you can use `useSearchParams` hook from `next/navigation` to get search params (only in client component)
		- use `<Suspend` with `key={xxx}` to make sure tell react that suspend must be re-render
		- Always check the build for the dynamic and static render
		- Use `process.env._XXX` to handle environment variables
		- all `NEXT_PUBLIC_XXX` environment variables is public
		- `redirect` should be done outside of the try/catch since is actually throw an error

		- [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/) ui lib
		- [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) generates ui using tailwind or shadcn/ui
		- [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for handle authentication with next.js apps

		- in vscode settings (specially in workspace) set `typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk`
		- `fetch` cache by default but on production build, not on dev environment. To force no cache, `export const dynamic = force-dynamic`
