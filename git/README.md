## Fixup

Keep your branch [clean with fixup][1] and autosquash

*git rebase i \<after-this-commit>*

 - `git commit --fixup <commit>` automatically marks your commit as a fix of a previous commit
 - `git commit --fixup :/foo` the most recent commit that contained the string foo in the first line of itâ€™s commit message. 
 - `git rebase -i --autosquash` automatically organize merging of these fixup commits and associated normal commits

**Summary**  

 - `git commit --fixup <COMMIT THAT NEEDS FIXING>`
 - `git rebase -i --autosquash <FIRST COMMIT THAT NEEDS FIXING>~1`
